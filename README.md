# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Overview
The task for module 5 Challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). A starter code was already provided with HTML and CSS. I added a Javascript and lines of code to make the website functional.
